/**
 * The theme choice, and why it lives in a cookie.
 *
 * The docs site and the app are separate origins — `zoblocks.design` and
 * `app.zoblocks.design` in production, `:6001` and `:6003` locally. A reader
 * who sets dark here and clicks "Sign in" should not be thrown into a white
 * login screen, so the choice has to survive the origin hop.
 *
 * `localStorage` cannot do that: it is keyed by scheme + host + **port**, so
 * the two apps could not read each other's value in either environment. A
 * cookie can, and for two different reasons that happen to line up:
 *
 *   - **Locally**, cookies ignore the port entirely. One set on `localhost`
 *     is sent to `localhost:6001` and `localhost:6003` alike.
 *   - **In production**, a cookie scoped to `.zoblocks.design` is sent to the
 *     apex and to every subdomain.
 *
 * `localStorage` is still written alongside it. That is not belt-and-braces:
 * `scripts/a11y.ts` drives the audit by setting `zoblocks-theme` in storage
 * before each pass, and the pre-paint script still reads it as a fallback, so
 * the high-contrast theme stays auditable even though the picker no longer
 * offers it.
 */

/**
 * Two, not four.
 *
 * `system` is gone as a *button* but not as behaviour — with nothing stored,
 * {@link resolveTheme} still follows `prefers-color-scheme`, so a reader whose
 * machine is dark still lands on dark. What has gone is the ability to pin
 * "follow the OS" as an explicit third state after choosing otherwise.
 *
 * `high-contrast` is gone from the picker but survives as a value. The token
 * build emits 59 tokens at a 7:1 floor behind `[data-zb-theme="high-contrast"]`
 * and the a11y script audits them; deleting the value would make that theme
 * unreachable again, which is the exact regression the comment in `globals.css`
 * was written about.
